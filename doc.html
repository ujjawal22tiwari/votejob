    <h2>Our Mission: Engineering Trust in a Digital World</h2>
    <p>
      In an era where digital information is constantly questioned, the integrity of a vote is more important than ever. 
      Our mission at UNI-VOTE is to restore and elevate trust in the democratic process. We are building a future where anyone, anywhere, can participate in elections with the absolute certainty that their voice is heard, their privacy is protected, and the results are undeniably fair. 
      We believe voting should be a right, not a risk.
    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge with Traditional & Digital Voting</h2>
    <p>
      For too long, voting systems have forced a choice between privacy and transparency. Traditional paper ballots can be slow and opaque, while early digital systems often expose voters’ identities or centralize control, creating new vulnerabilities. 
      How can you be sure your vote was counted correctly? And how can you be certain your choice remains a secret?
    </p>
    <p>UNI-VOTE was born to solve this dilemma.</p>

    <h2>Our Solution: Privacy Meets Verifiability</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>We’ve engineered a platform that offers perfect transparency and absolute privacy by combining two groundbreaking technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blockchain for Verifiability:</strong> Every valid vote is recorded on a public ledger, creating a permanent and unchangeable audit trail that proves the final count is accurate.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Anonymity:</strong> Our cryptographic engine allows you to prove you’re an eligible voter without revealing who you are. Your identity is mathematically separated from your vote, forever.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Join Us in Building the Future of Democracy</h2>
    <p>
      UNI-VOTE is more than a platform; it’s a movement towards a more secure and transparent digital society. 
      Explore our features, create an election, and experience the future of voting today.
